I've created a comprehensive, feature-rich surveillance interface that's fully integrated with Django! Here are the key enhancements:
ðŸŽ¯ Core Features
Live Settings Panel:

Video Configuration: Resolution (4K/1080p/720p/480p), frame rate slider, brightness/contrast controls
AI Detection: Toggle switches for motion, person, and vehicle detection with sensitivity slider
Recording Settings: Auto-recording toggle, quality selection, real-time recording status

Enhanced Video Player:

Floating Design: Animated container with 3D effects and ambient lighting
Overlay Controls: Fullscreen, snapshot capture, and recording toggle
Real-time Filters: Live brightness/contrast adjustment
AI Detection Overlays: Visual bounding boxes with confidence scores

ðŸ”§ Django Integration
WebSocket Communication:
javascript// Sends settings to Django backend
socket.send(JSON.stringify({
    type: 'settings_update',
    settings: state.settings
}));

// Handles various message types
- 'frame': Video frame data
- 'detection': AI detection results  
- 'recording_status': Recording state
- 'settings_update': Configuration changes
API Endpoints:

POST /api/save-settings/: Persist settings to database
GET /api/get-settings/: Load saved settings
Includes CSRF protection for Django security

ðŸš€ Advanced Features
Real-time Analytics:

Live FPS counter, latency monitoring, detection counter
Connection status with automatic reconnection
Recording status with visual indicators

Interactive Controls:

Custom Sliders: Smooth range inputs with live values
Toggle Switches: Animated on/off controls
Dropdown Menus: Glass morphism styled selectors
Action Buttons: Save/reset with confirmation dialogs

Visual Effects:

Particle System: Animated background particles
Grid Animation: Moving grid overlay
3D Hover Effects: Cards tilt and lift on interaction
Gradient Overlays: Smooth color transitions

ðŸ“± Responsive Design

The interface now provides a professional, enterprise-grade surveillance experience with all settings functional and connected to your Django backend. All controls send real-time updates via WebSocket, and the system includes proper error handling, notifications, and state management.
